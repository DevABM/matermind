# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
To create a Mastermind game, which is a game composed of 9 pieces of different colors. A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.
The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code. After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.

## Description
Mastermind is a code-breaking game played by two players (or one player against the computer).

Goal: Guess a hidden code within a limited number of attempts.

Secret code: Usually 4 pieces (colors or numbers) chosen from a set (in your implementation: digits '0' to '8').

Pieces are distinct: No duplicates in the secret code.

## Installation
The project is created and executed in C. The various functions such as printf, write, read, rand, time, atoi and strcmp were used to achieve the task.

## Usage
Mastermind is a classic logic and deduction game:

The player must guess a secret code based on feedback (well-placed and misplaced pieces).

It helps train logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.

Your my_mastermind program allows:

Practicing loops, conditionals, and arrays in C.

Handling input carefully (reading character by character).

Working with randomization (rand()) and seeding (srand(time(NULL))).

Implementing game rules and enforcing constraints.
